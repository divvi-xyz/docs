Comments on posts create threaded, hierarchical discussions. Comments themselves are blockchain-native posts linked explicitly to parent posts.

## Creating Comments

To comment, you must know the original post's ID and the author's shared user ID:

```javascript
const commentResult = await sageClient.commentOnPost({
  authorSharedUserId: 'original-author-shared-id',
  parentPostId: 'parent-post-id',
  title: 'Great insights!',
  description: 'Adding my perspective',
  data: 'I completely agree with your points, especially regarding scalability...',
  ownedUserId: 'your-owned-user-id',
  self: walletAddress
});

if (commentResult.ok) {
  await signAndExecuteTransaction({ transaction: commentResult.transaction });
} else {
  console.error(commentResult.err);
}
```

### Threaded Discussions Example

Threads follow a clear hierarchy, making discussions easy to follow:

- 📝 Original Post: "Smart Contract Best Practices"
  - 💬 Comment: "Excellent overview. How do you handle security audits?"
    - 💬 Reply: "We regularly use automated auditing tools and professional auditors."
  - 💬 Comment: "Here are additional resources for further reading..."
