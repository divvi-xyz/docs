Comments on posts create threaded, hierarchical discussions. Comments themselves are blockchain-native posts linked explicitly to parent posts.

## Creating Comments

To comment, you must know the original post's ID and the author's shared user ID:

```typescript
const commentResult = await sageClient.commentOnPost({
  amounts: [0, 0],                               // Required protocol fees
  appId: 'your-app-id',                          // Required application ID
  network: 'testnet',                            // 'testnet' or 'mainnet'
  authorSharedUserId: 'original-author-shared-id', // Original post author's shared user object ID
  parentPostId: 'parent-post-id',                // ID of the original post
  title: 'Great insights!',                      // Comment title in markdown
  description: 'Adding my perspective',          // Comment summary in markdown
  data: 'I completely agree with your points, especially regarding scalability...', // Main markdown content
  ownedUserId: 'your-owned-user-id',             // Commenter's owned user ID
  self: walletAddress                            // Commenter's wallet address
});

if (commentResult.ok) {
  await signAndExecuteTransaction({ transaction: commentResult.transaction });
} else {
  console.error(commentResult.err);
}
```

### Threaded Discussions Example

Threads follow a clear hierarchy, making discussions easy to follow:

- üìù Original Post: "Smart Contract Best Practices"
  - üí¨ Comment: "Excellent overview. How do you handle security audits?"
    - üí¨ Reply: "We regularly use automated auditing tools and professional auditors."
  - üí¨ Comment: "Here are additional resources for further reading..."
