Posts are the cornerstone of content interactions in Sage Protocol. Users create and engage with blockchain-native content across channels and user profiles, with each interaction transparently recorded onchain.

Posts support rich markdown formatting, including text, headers, images, and embedded links.

## Posting in Channels

Users must follow a channel to create posts in it:

```javascript
const postResult = await sageClient.postToChannel({
  channelId: 'channel-id',
  title: 'Sui vs Ethereum: An In-Depth Analysis',
  description: 'Comparing scalability, security, and more.',
  data: 'Sui provides high throughput and low latency compared to Ethereum...',
  ownedUserId: 'your-owned-user-id',
  self: walletAddress
});

if (postResult.ok) {
  await signAndExecuteTransaction({ transaction: postResult.transaction });
} else {
  console.error(postResult.err);
}
```

## Posting on User Profiles

Direct posts to user profiles, enabling personal interactions, endorsements, or recommendations:

```javascript
const postResult = await sageClient.postToUser({
  sharedUserId: 'target-user-shared-id',
  title: 'Professional Endorsement',
  description: 'Recognizing outstanding contributions',
  data: 'Thanks for your amazing support and mentorship!',
  ownedUserId: 'your-owned-user-id',
  self: walletAddress
});

if (postResult.ok) {
  await signAndExecuteTransaction({ transaction: postResult.transaction });
} else {
  console.error(postResult.err);
}
```

## Common Post Use Cases

- **Technical Discussions:**\
  Posts comparing technologies, discussing best practices, or sharing research.
- **Community Updates:**\
  Regular announcements, project news, or progress reports.
- **Professional Endorsements:**\
  Public recommendations or acknowledgments on user profiles.

### Content Guidelines and Best Practices

- **Markdown Formatting:** Posts support rich markdown. Ensure your app sanitizes user inputs thoroughly to prevent security risks like XSS attacks.
- **Threaded Conversations:** Clearly indicate comment threads in your app UI to maintain context.
- **Moderation:** Use built-in moderation tools to proactively manage content quality, enforce community standards, and quickly address inappropriate behavior.
- **Encourage Meaningful Engagement:** Design interfaces and incentives to prompt thoughtful interactions, promoting community vibrancy.
