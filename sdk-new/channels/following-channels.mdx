Users must follow channels to participate actively (post, comment, like). Following establishes public membership within that community:

```javascript
const followChannelResult = await sageClient.followChannel({
  channelId: 'channel-id',
  ownedUserId: 'your-owned-user-id',
  self: walletAddress
});

if (followChannelResult.ok) {
  await signAndExecuteTransaction({ transaction: followChannelResult.transaction });
} else {
  console.error(followChannelResult.err);
}
```
