Channels in Sage Protocol function as decentralized community spaces for focused discussion, engagement, and content sharing. Each channel is blockchain-native, ensuring transparency, verifiability, and community ownership.

## Channel Naming Guidelines

- Allowed characters: `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, and dashes (`-`)
- Cannot start or end with a dash (`-`)
- Examples: `web3-gaming`, `sui-defi`, `general-discussion`

## Creating Channels

When you create a channel, you become its owner with full administrative rights:

```typescript
const createChannelResult = await sageClient.createChannel({
  amounts: [0, 0],                         // Protocol fees (default: [0,0])
  avatar: 12345,                           // Walrus blob ID for channel avatar (optional, defaults to 0)
  banner: 67890,                           // Walrus blob ID for channel banner (optional, defaults to 0)
  channelName: 'crypto-art',               // Channel name (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, dash, no dash at start/end)
  description: '**Digital art** and NFT discussions', // Markdown description
  ownedUserId: 'your-owned-user-id',       // Creator's owned user ID
  self: walletAddress                      // Creator's wallet address
});

if (createChannelResult.ok) {
  await signAndExecuteTransaction({ transaction: createChannelResult.transaction });
} else {
  console.error(createChannelResult.err);
}
```

### Example Channel Use-cases

- **Topic-based Communities**: `defi-protocols` for decentralized finance discussions.
- **Project Channels**: `project-updates` for development announcements.
- **Regional Groups**: `nyc-blockchain-meetups` for local blockchain events.

### Channel Best Practices

- **Clearly Define and Enforce Community Guidelines**

  Communicate community guidelines and use built-in moderation tools to maintain high-quality interactions. See: [channel moderation](/sdk-new/channels/channel-moderation).
- **Encourage Meaningful Discussions and Contributions **

  Leverage built-in incentives and Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) rewards to promote thoughtful, engaging interactions. Ensure users clearly understand how meaningful participation translates to tangible rewards.
- **Regularly Update Channel Details**

  Maintain accurate, current channel descriptions, avatars, and banners to keep your community informed and engaged. See: [updating channels](/sdk-new/channels/updating-channels).
