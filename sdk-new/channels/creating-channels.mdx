Channels in Sage Protocol function as decentralized community spaces for focused discussion, engagement, and content sharing. Each channel is blockchain-native, ensuring transparency, verifiability, and community ownership.

## Creating Channels

When you create a channel, you become its owner with full administrative rights:

```javascript
const createChannelResult = await sageClient.createChannel({
  channelName: 'crypto-art',
  description: '**Digital art** and NFT discussions',
  avatar: 'avatar_blob_id',
  banner: 'banner_blob_id',
  ownedUserId: 'your-owned-user-id',
  self: walletAddress
});

if (createChannelResult.ok) {
  await signAndExecuteTransaction({ transaction: createChannelResult.transaction });
} else {
  console.error(createChannelResult.err);
}
```

### Channel Naming Guidelines

- Allowed characters: `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, and dashes (`-`)
- Cannot start or end with a dash (`-`)
- Examples: `web3-gaming`, `sui-defi`, `general-discussion`

### Example Channel Use-cases

- **Topic-based Communities**: `defi-protocols` for decentralized finance discussions.
- **Project Channels**: `project-updates` for development announcements.
- **Regional Groups**: `nyc-blockchain-meetups` for local blockchain events.

### Channel Best Practices

- **Clearly define and enforce community guidelines** using moderation tools to ensure high-quality engagement.
- **Encourage meaningful discussions and contributions** by leveraging built-in incentives and PoSC rewards.
- **Regularly update channel details and descriptions** to maintain clarity and relevance to your community.
