Users are central to Sage Protocolâ€™s decentralized social ecosystem. Every user maintains a global identity across all Sage-enabled apps while interacting uniquely within each application.

## Creating Users

Creating a user establishes a global identity within Sage. Currently, user creation requires invite codes and keys:

```typescript
const result = await sageClient.createUser({
  amounts: [0, 0],                           // required, typically [0,0] by default
  avatar: 0,                                 // optional avatar blob ID (default: 0)
  banner: 0,                                 // optional banner blob ID (default: 0)
  description: "Blockchain enthusiast",      // markdown supported
  inviteCode: "your-invite-code",            // required invite code
  inviteKey: "your-invite-key",              // required invite key
  name: "john-doe",                          // globally unique username
  self: walletAddress                        // user's wallet address
});

if (result.ok) {
  await signAndExecuteTransaction({ transaction: result.transaction });
} else {
  console.error(result.err);
}
```

### **User Identities Explained**

Sage generates two distinct user objects:

- **Owned User Object**: Soulbound to your wallet. Authenticates your wallet as a valid protocol user, enabling you to create content, follow users, and perform other wallet-signed actions.
- **Shared User Object**: Publicly referenced by others for social interactions (e.g., friending, following, or engaging with your content).

(This distinction is typically only relevant for developers.)

## User Management Best Practices

To ensure optimal user experiences and secure integrations, follow these best practices:

- **Wallet Connections & Signing: **Clearly guide users through wallet connection steps and transaction signing flows, explicitly explaining each step to minimize confusion.
- **Input Validation & Security: **Validate all user inputs rigorously. Ensure markdown content is sanitized thoroughly to prevent security risks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Clear User Feedback: **Always provide clear, immediate, and understandable feedback on successful actions and error states. This significantly improves user confidence and interaction quality.
- **Intuitive Social Interaction Interfaces: **Design clear and intuitive interfaces for managing follows, friendships, favorites, and other social relationships. Provide users easy and obvious pathways for performing these actions.
- **Explicit User State Management (React Integration): **When using React, always leverage Sage's provided hooks (`useUser`, `useChannel`, `usePost`) within the `SageProvider` context to clearly and reliably manage user operations across your app.

  **Example**:

  ```typescript
  import { SageProvider, useUser } from '@sageprotocol/sdk/react';
  
  function App() {
    return (
      <SageProvider
        appId="your-app-id"
        channelRegistryId="your-channel-registry-id"
        network="testnet"
      >
        <UserProfile />
      </SageProvider>
    );
  }
  
  function UserProfile() {
    const { create, update, follow } = useUser();
    
    // explicitly manage user state and related operations within SageProvider context
  }
  ```
