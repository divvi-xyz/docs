Channels in Sage Protocol are decentralized community spaces designed for focused discussions, meaningful engagement, and explicit content sharing. When creating a channel, ownership and full administrative privileges are automatically assigned to the creator.

## Channel Naming Guidelines

To maintain clarity and consistency, adhere explicitly to these naming conventions:

- **Allowed characters:** `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, and dashes (`-`).
- **Restrictions:** Channel names cannot explicitly start or end with a dash (`-`).
- **Examples:** `web3-gaming`, `sui-defi`, `general-discussion`.

## Example Channel Use-cases

Channels are versatile community spaces suitable for various explicit use-cases:

- **Topic-based Communities**: Example: `defi-protocols` for decentralized finance discussions.
- **Project Channels**: Example:`project-updates` for development announcements.
- **Regional Groups**: Example:`nyc-blockchain-meetups` for local blockchain events.

## Core Channel Capabilities

Channels support several critical community functions:

- **Content Creation:** Only channel followers can explicitly post, ensuring genuine community engagement.
- **Membership Management:** Follow/unfollow channels to manage participation.
- **Moderation:** Channel owners manage moderators and enforce community standards clearly and transparently.
- **Content Visibility & Rewards:** Posts and interactions improve content visibility and can directly trigger incremental rewards through the Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) mechanism.

## Best Practices for Channel Management

- **Clearly Define and Enforce Community Guidelines**\
  Explicitly communicate your community’s standards and use built-in moderation tools proactively to ensure quality interactions.
- **Encourage Meaningful Discussions and Contributions**\
  Clearly inform members about the built-in rewards and incentives explicitly linked to genuine, quality interactions.
- **Regularly Update Channel Details**\
  Explicitly maintain accurate descriptions, avatars, and banners, clearly reflecting the channel's purpose and ensuring ongoing member engagement.

## React Integration Summary

Channels explicitly integrate smoothly into React applications using Sage SDK’s built-in hooks.

```typescript
import { SageProvider, useChannel } from '@sageprotocol/sdk/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <SageProvider
      appId="your-app-id"
      channelRegistryId="your-channel-registry-id"
      network="testnet"
    >
      <Channel />
    </SageProvider>
  );
}

function Channel() {
  const { createChannel, follow, unfollow, update } = useChannel();

  // Explicitly manage channel-related actions here
}

export default App;
```

  ```javascript
  import { SageClient } from '@sageprotocol/sdk';
  
  const sageClient = new SageClient({
    appId: 'your-app-id',                    // explicitly required unique app context
    channelRegistryId: 'your-registry-id',   // required channel registry ID
    network: 'testnet'                       // 'testnet' or 'mainnet'
  });
  
  await sageClient.initialize();
  
  // Example channel-related operations:
  const createChannelResult = await sageClient.createChannel({
    amounts: [0, 0],
    avatar: 12345,
    banner: 67890,
    channelName: 'crypto-art',
    description: '**Digital art and NFT discussions**',
    ownedUserId: 'your-owned-user-id',
    self: walletAddress
  });
  
  if (createChannelResult.ok) {
    await signAndExecuteTransaction({ transaction: createChannelResult.transaction });
  } else {
    console.error('Error creating channel:', createChannelResult.err);
  }
  ```
</Accordion>
