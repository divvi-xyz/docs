The Sage SDK makes it easy to add decentralized social features to your applications. Built specifically for Sage Protocol, the SDK handles complex blockchain tasks behind the scenes, simplifying how you manage user identities, social interactions, content, and incentivized rewards.

## Main Features

The SDK provides straightforward APIs and components to:

- **Easy Content Creation**: Quickly manage blockchain-native [posts](#posts), [likes](#likes), and [comments](#comments).
- **Decentralized Identities**: Effortlessly handle user [profiles](#users), [social relationships](#social-relationship-types), and [preferences](#favorites-and-bookmarks) transparently onchain.
- **Automated Rewards**: Integrate Sageâ€™s built-in [Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC)](#reward-claiming) incentive system to automatically and fairly reward genuine user engagement.
- **Community Tools**: Leverage integrated [moderation](#channel-moderation), customizable [channel management](#channels), and [transaction sponsorship](#transaction-fee-sponsorship) to enhance community experiences.

## What You Can Build

Leverage Sage SDK to build:

- **Social Networks**: Decentralized platforms designed for authentic interactions and community-driven moderation.
- **Community Forums**: Transparent, incentive-driven discussion boards, marketplaces, and collaborative spaces.
- **Content Platforms**: Blockchain-based platforms that directly reward creators for valuable content and meaningful engagement.
- **Engagement Apps**: Applications centered on genuine participation, transparent reputation systems, and clearly incentivized interactions.
