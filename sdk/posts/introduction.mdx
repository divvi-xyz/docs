Posts are central to content interactions within Sage Protocol, explicitly supporting rich markdown formatting and enabling transparent, blockchain-native engagement within channels and user profiles.

## Core Features of Posts

Sage Protocol‚Äôs posts offer:

- **Rich Content Formatting:** Supports markdown, headers, images, and embedded links.
- **Explicit Ownership:** All posts are transparently linked to their creators and are explicitly recorded onchain.
- **Threaded Discussions:** Comments are structured explicitly as linked blockchain-native posts, ensuring clear and hierarchical conversational context.
- **Engagement Rewards:** Explicit interactions (likes, comments, bookmarks) enhance content visibility and trigger incremental rewards through Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC).

## Markdown Formatting Best Practices:

Posts support comprehensive markdown formatting. Example:

**Example**:

```markdown
# Heading
**Bold Text**  
![Image](https://example.com/image.png)  
[Link](https://example.com)
```

- Security Note: Always explicitly sanitize user-generated markdown content to prevent security risks (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting).

## Threaded Conversations:

Explicitly structure comment threads clearly within the UI to maintain conversational clarity:

- üìù **Original Post:** "Blockchain Scalability Insights"
  - üí¨ **Comment:** "Can you elaborate on sharding?"
    - üí¨ **Reply:** "Certainly\! Sharding divides blockchain state into manageable pieces..."
  - üí¨ **Comment:** "Great overview, thanks for sharing\!"

## Moderation Tools:

Leverage built-in moderation functions (addModerator, removeModerator) to ensure proactive content management and uphold community guidelines clearly.

## Encouraging Engagement:

Highlight and communicate the tangible rewards users earn through meaningful interactions using the Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) mechanism.

## Common Use Cases for Posts:

Suited to a variety of scenarios:

- **Technical Discussions:**\
  Comparing technologies, best practices, research insights.
- **Community Updates:**\
  Regular announcements, project news, progress reports.
- **Professional Endorsements:**\
  Publicly acknowledge or recommend individuals directly on user profiles.

## React Integration Summary

Manage posts explicitly using Sage SDK‚Äôs dedicated React hooks (`usePost`) in the provided `SageProvider` context:

```typescript
import { SageProvider, usePost } from '@sageprotocol/sdk/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <SageProvider
      appId="your-app-id"
      channelRegistryId="your-channel-registry-id"
      network="testnet"
    >
      <PostComponent />
    </SageProvider>
  );
}

function PostComponent() {
  const { postToChannel, postToUser, commentOnPost } = usePost();

  // Explicitly handle post-related actions here
}

export default App;
```
