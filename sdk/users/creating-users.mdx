Users are foundational to Sage Protocol’s decentralized social ecosystem, maintaining global identities consistent across all Sage-enabled applications, yet interacting uniquely within each.

## Creating a New User

Establishing a user identity currently requires valid invite codes and keys. Using Sage’s React hooks simplifies the user creation process within your React application.

**React Hook Example**:

```typescript
import { useUser } from '@sageprotocol/sdk/react';
import { useWallet } from '@suiet/wallet-kit';

function CreateUser() {
  const { create } = useUser();
  const { account, signAndExecuteTransaction } = useWallet();

  const handleCreateUser = async () => {
    const result = await create({
      amounts: [0, 0],                        // Required; typically [0,0] by default
      avatar: 0,                              // Optional avatar blob ID (default: 0)
      banner: 0,                              // Optional banner blob ID (default: 0)
      description: "Blockchain enthusiast",   // Supports markdown formatting
      inviteCode: "your-invite-code",         // Required invite code
      inviteKey: "your-invite-key",           // Required invite key
      name: "john-doe",                       // Globally unique username
      self: account.address                   // User's connected wallet address
    });

    if (result.ok) {
      await signAndExecuteTransaction({ transaction: result.transaction });
      console.log("User created successfully!");
    } else {
      console.error("User creation error:", result.err);
    }
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleCreateUser}>
      Create User
    </button>
  );
}

export default CreateUser;
```

## Understanding User Identities

Sage Protocol generates two distinct user objects upon creation:

- **Owned User Object**:
  - Soulbound to your wallet.
  - Authenticates your wallet to perform actions (creating content, following users, and other wallet-signed interactions).
- **Shared User Object**:
  - Publicly accessible by other users.
  - Enables social interactions like follows, friendships, and content engagement.

_Note_: Typically, only developers need to handle these distinctions directly.

## Best Practices for User Management

Follow these best practices for optimal user experiences and secure integrations:

- **Wallet Connections & Signing**:\
  Guide users explicitly through wallet connections and clearly explain each step of the signing process to enhance clarity and trust.
- **Input Validation & Security**:\
  Thoroughly validate and sanitize user inputs, particularly markdown content, to mitigate security risks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Clear User Feedback**:\
  Provide users immediate, understandable feedback for successful interactions or errors. This boosts user confidence and interaction quality.
- **Intuitive Social Interfaces**:\
  Design interfaces that clearly manage social interactions (follows, friendships, favorites). Ensure easy, obvious pathways for users to engage socially.
- **Explicit React State Management**:\
  Use Sage SDK’s React hooks (`useUser`, `useChannel`, `usePost`) within the provided `SageProvider` context to reliably manage user-related state and operations.

**Example setup in React**:

```typescript
import { SageProvider, useUser } from '@sageprotocol/sdk/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <SageProvider
      appId="your-app-id"
      channelRegistryId="your-channel-registry-id"
      network="testnet"
    >
      <UserProfile />
    </SageProvider>
  );
}

function UserProfile() {
  const { create, update, follow } = useUser();

  // Explicitly manage user state and operations here
}

export default App;
```

Following these guidelines ensures your React application provides a seamless, secure, and engaging decentralized social experience powered by Sage Protocol.
