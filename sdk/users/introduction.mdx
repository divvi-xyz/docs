title: "Introduction to Users"
---

Users are foundational to Sage Protocol’s decentralized social ecosystem, maintaining consistent global identities across all Sage-enabled applications, yet interacting uniquely within each.

## Understanding User Identities

Upon creation, Sage Protocol generates two distinct user objects:

- **Owned User Object (Private)**:
  - Soulbound to your wallet.
  - Authenticates actions requiring wallet signatures (posting content, following users).
- **Shared User Object (Public)**:
  - Publicly accessible, enabling transparent social interactions (follows, friendships, content engagements).

_Note: Typically, handling these distinctions is relevant for developers only._

## Core User Capabilities

Users within Sage Protocol can:

- **Manage Profiles:** Update profiles explicitly (avatar, banner, description) to clearly express identity.
- **Establish Connections:** Create transparent social interactions explicitly as follows or mutual friendships.
- **Engage Socially:** Directly post on user profiles to explicitly foster community engagement and personal interactions.
- **Bookmark Favorites:** Easily bookmark and organize preferred posts, channels, and other users.
- **Earn Rewards:** Participate explicitly in social activities, earning \$TRUST tokens through the Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) mechanism.

## Best Practices for User Experiences

- **Wallet Management:** Clearly guide users through wallet connections and transactions for a secure experience.
- **Transparent Feedback:** Explicitly inform users about transaction outcomes to enhance trust.
- **Secure & Validated Inputs:** Always sanitize user-generated content explicitly to maintain security.

## React Integration Summary

Utilize Sage SDK’s built-in React hooks (`useUser`, `useChannel`, `usePost`) and the provided `SageProvider` context for explicitly streamlined state management and operations.

```typescript
import { SageProvider, useUser } from '@sageprotocol/sdk/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <SageProvider
      appId="your-app-id"
      channelRegistryId="your-channel-registry-id"
      network="testnet"
    >
      <UserProfile />
    </SageProvider>
  );
}

function UserProfile() {
  const { create, update, follow } = useUser();

  // Explicitly manage user state and operations here
}

export default App;
```
