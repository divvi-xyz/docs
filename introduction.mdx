Prem is a powerful AI platform that gives you all the tools necessary to create custom AI models through [Autonomous Fine-Tuning](/finetuning/overview). 

Prem can also be used to [evaluate](/evaluations/overview) your models with our built-in metrics and tools.

Just load your [dataset](/datasets/overview), choose a model, and in a few minutes, you can have a distilled, fine-tuned model ready to use in no time.

We designed Prem to make AI integration seamless, efficient, and effective so that you can focus on developing your product and not all the AI complexity.

We're different from other evaluation platforms and instead we give you the full package from chat completions to fine-tuning and evaluations.

Read out our [Quickstart Guide](/introduction) to get started in minutes.

### TL;DR 
**With Prem you can:**

- Access the best in class AI models without any vendor lock-in.
- [Autonomously fine-tune](/finetuning/overview) models with your own datasets to customize for your use case.
- [Evaluate](/evaluations/overview) your models with our built-in metrics and tools.
- Test your models with our built-in [Playground](/playground/overview).
- Keep track of your models and their performance over time with [Stats](/stats/overview).
