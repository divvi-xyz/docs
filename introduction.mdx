Prem is a powerful AI platform that gives you all the tools necessary to create your own custom reasoning models without the need to be a machine learning engineer.

Just load your dataset, choose a model, and in one click, you can have a distilled, fine-tuned model ready to use in no time.

We designed Prem to make AI integration seamless, efficient, and effective so that you can focus on developing your product and not all the AI complexity.


### Heres what you can do with Prem:

- Access the best in class AI models without any vendor lock-in.
- [Autonomously fine-tune models](/get-started/autonomous-fine-tuning) to customize for your use case.
- Use our [SDKs](/get-started/sdk) to integrate Prem into your own codebase.
- Bring your own datasets and/or collect traces to accurately fine-tune your models.
- Take advantage of model distillation to create smaller, more efficient models.
- Securely integrate your documents into your models without having to build your own RAG.
- Bring your own [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) vector database.
- Deploy your models to your own local infrastructure.
