## Functions

### calculateKpi()

```ts
function calculateKpi(params): Promise<KpiResult<string>>
```

Defined in: [baseV0/index.ts:48](https://github.com/divvi-xyz/divvi-protocol/blob/main/scripts/calculateKpi/protocols/baseV0/index.ts#L48)

Calculates gas usage for Base infrastructure activity.

**KPI Unit**: Gas units (computational units consumed)

**Business Purpose**: Measures the computational resources (gas) consumed by a specific user's
transactions on Base network. This metric quantifies the infrastructure utilization generated by user
interactions and supports gas usage analysis for network sustainability and resource allocation.

**Protocol Context**: Base tracks gas consumption to measure network utilization
and infrastructure impact. Gas usage serves as a proxy for computational resource consumption and
network contribution, supporting infrastructure funding decisions and network optimization.

**Network**: Base Mainnet

**Data Sources**:

- **HyperSync**: Transaction and gas usage data from Base network via HyperSync client
- **Block Data**: Timestamps via `getBlockRange` utility for temporal filtering

**Business Assumptions**:

- Gas usage accurately represents computational resource consumption
- User's infrastructure impact is proportional to total gas consumed within time window
- All transaction types contribute equally to network utilization regardless of purpose
- Gas measurements include both successful and failed transaction attempts
- Infrastructure funding allocation can be based on proportional gas contribution

**Gas Types**: Transaction execution gas, contract interaction gas, token transfer gas, and smart contract deployment gas

**Calculation Method**:

1. Queries all transactions initiated by user wallet within the specified time window
2. Retrieves transaction receipts to extract gas used for each transaction
3. Filters transactions by block timestamp to ensure they fall within the time range
4. Aggregates total gas consumed across all user transactions
5. Returns total gas usage representing user's infrastructure utilization

#### Parameters

##### params

Calculation parameters

###### address

`string`

User wallet address to calculate gas usage for

###### endTimestampExclusive

`Date`

End of time window for gas calculation (exclusive)

###### redis?

`RedisClientType`

###### startTimestamp

`Date`

Start of time window for gas calculation (inclusive)

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`KpiResult`\<`string`\>\>

Promise resolving to total gas units consumed by user's transactions and metadata including total transactions
