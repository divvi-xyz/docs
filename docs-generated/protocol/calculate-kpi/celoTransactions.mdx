## Functions

### calculateKpi()

```ts
function calculateKpi(params): Promise<KpiResult<string>>
```

Defined in: [celoTransactions/index.ts:47](https://github.com/divvi-xyz/divvi-protocol/blob/main/scripts/calculateKpi/protocols/celoTransactions/index.ts#L47)

Calculates transaction count for Celo network activity.

**KPI Unit**: Transaction count (number of transactions)

**Business Purpose**: Measures the number of transactions initiated by a specific user on Celo network.
This metric quantifies user engagement and activity level on the blockchain, supporting network
usage analysis and user behavior tracking for Celo ecosystem development.

**Protocol Context**: Celo is a carbon-negative, mobile-first blockchain platform designed for financial
inclusion. Transaction count tracking helps measure user engagement and network adoption by counting
actual on-chain interactions initiated by users.

**Network**: Celo Mainnet

**Data Sources**:

- **HyperSync**: Transaction data from Celo network via HyperSync client
- **Block Data**: Timestamps via `getBlockRange` utility for temporal filtering

**Business Assumptions**:

- Transaction count accurately represents user engagement with the network
- All user-initiated transactions contribute equally to activity metrics regardless of value or purpose
- Higher transaction counts indicate more active user participation in the ecosystem
- Transaction frequency serves as a proxy for user adoption and platform utility
- Both successful and failed transactions represent legitimate user engagement attempts

**Transaction Types**: Token transfers, smart contract interactions, DeFi protocol usage, and dApp engagement

**Calculation Method**:

1. Queries all transactions initiated by user wallet within the specified time window on Celo
2. Filters transactions by block timestamp to ensure they fall within the time range
3. Counts the total number of transactions regardless of success status or transaction value
4. Returns total transaction count representing user's network engagement level
