<Warning>Currently, we only support text-to-text projects (LLMs). However, we plan to introduce text-to-image support soon.</Warning>
Each project can be used to address a specific use case. For example, if you run an online store and use **Prem**, you could initiate a project titled “Customer Support” to address questions from your customers.

On the other hand you can create a project that integrates and LLM for an entire application.

You can also create new projects, modify them, or delete them if you need to. Think of each project as a test lab for trying out AI in ways that help your business.<img
