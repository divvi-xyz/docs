## Playground


In the Lab you have the ability to create a **Playground**. 

**Playgrounds** are a great way to experiment with various language models simultaneously and test them with any text you desire. 

You can adjust settings such as creativity level (temperature) and output length (max tokens). In addtion you have can add a repository to grant the language models access to your documents for easy setup of RAG.

### In this guide we will cover the following:

1. **How to select models:** Choose from a variety of models, both open-source and closed-source, from multiple providers.
2. **Adjust settings:** Experiment with temperature, max tokens, and system prompts to tailor the AI models's behavior.
3. **Testing Text:** Enter the text you want the AI to continue or generate new content from.
4. **Viewing Results:** Analyze the output generated by the AI models.
5. **RAG:** Add a repository to grant the language models access to your documents for easy setup of RAG.
6. **Sharing:** Share the results with others for feedback or further analysis.

## Get started: A step by step guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new playground or use the default playground to get started.">

  When you first enter the Lab you will be presented with the default playground. You can create a new playground by clicking the **+ New playground** button in the top left corner.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add more language models so you can test them simultaneously.">
**Prem** gives you the ability to observe how different AI models behave under various conditions.

  </Step>
   <Step title="Customize the models in the Params section.">

The **_Params_** section is your go-to place to configure language models and adjust system prompts for the language model of your choice.
<Card title="Param settings" icon="lightbulb" iconType="duotone" color="#a986c5">
**Max Tokens:** Limit for generated tokens in a chat, constrained by the model's context length (value 0 means no limit).

**Temperature:** This parameter in language models affects the creativity or diversity of the generated text. You can set the randomness level (0 to 1). Higher values increase randomness, and the results will be more creative, with the model generating more diverse output. Lower values result in more focused and deterministic output (great for working with repositories).

**System Prompt:** The system prompt sets the initial context and direction for the model's responses. It should be carefully selected to align with the specific topic and desired style of the conversation.

  </Step>
   <Step title="Add a repository to grant the language models access to your documents for easy setup of RAG.">
   <Tip>
   Click here to learn more about [Repositories](/get-started/repositories). This is how you can give your AI models knowledge of your documents.
   </Tip>
   <Card title="Repository settings" icon="lightbulb" iconType="duotone" color="#a986c5">
**Limit:** Sets the maximum number of top-matching documents to retrieve based on similarity.

**Similarity:** Measures how closely a query matches document embeddings. Higher values indicate greater similarity, ranging from 0 to 1.

  </Step>
  <Step title = "Trace & Launch from the lab">
  - Use the **Trace** tool to explore the results and sub components of the language model's response.

  - While in the lab, you can fast-track your way to launch. If you decide to launch a model from the lab, the model you choose will automatically load in the lab along with the params and repositories you've set with it.
  </Step>
  <Step title ="Share your experiemts">
  Feel free to **share** your experiments with your colleagues or online communities.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Don't worry about losing your tests; all activities in the Lab are saved. You can revisit them to analyze what worked well and what didnâ€™t.  
</Tip>

## Chats: Experiment with one model at a time

In the **Chat** section, you can interact with a language model in a conversational manner. Unlike the Playground, where you can experiment with multiple models simultaneously, here you can focus on testing out one model in a chat-like manner.

Similar to the Playground, you can **adjust settings** such as max tokens, temperature, and system prompts to customize the AI's responses. Additionally, you can **share** the chat sessions with others for collaboration or feedback.
