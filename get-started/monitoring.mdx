It's crucial to have robust monitoring and tracing capabilities to ensure a Large Language Model's reliability and efficiency. **Prem** provides a comprehensive interface and SDK to enable real-time monitoring and tracing of LLMs, empowering developers and stakeholders to gain valuable insights into model performance, identify and resolve issues, and continuously improve the model's behavior.




## Why Monitoring and Tracing are Essential
Monitoring and tracing are key for LLM performance optimization.
These observability tools allow you to assess the efficiency of your LLM in real-time.
By identifying performance bottlenecks and anomalies, you can take proactive measures to optimize the model's performance and ensure a smooth user experience.

Prem's monitoring and tracing tools are specifically designed for LLMs.
## Key features
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Track key performance metrics, such as latency and throughput, in real-time through our intuitive interface.
