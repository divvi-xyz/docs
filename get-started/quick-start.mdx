<Note>
This is a quickstart guide for using the **Chat Completions** funcationality. If you want to learn about [Datasets](/datasets/overview), [Autonomous Fine-Tuning](/finetuning/overview), [Evaluations](/evaluations/overview), [Stats](/stats/overview) and [Playground](/playground/overview), please refer to those guides.
</Note>


The quickest way to get started with Prem is to use the OpenAI SDKs for chat completions as shown below.

<Note>
The Prem AI API can also be used with any programming language that has a HTTP client and/or with the OpenAI SDKs. 

For API usage documentation, refer to the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction).
</Note>

### Install the OpenAI SDKs
<CodeGroup>
```bash javascript/typescript
npm install openai;
```
```bash python
pip install openai;
```
</CodeGroup>

### Perfrom A Chat Completion
<CodeGroup>
```javascript javascript/typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI({
    baseURL: "https://sid.premai.io/api/v1/",
    apiKey: process.env.PREMAI_API_KEY,
});

//Create a chat completion
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o", //Or any other model you want to use
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn." }]
});

console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
```
```python python
import os
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://sid.premai.io/api/v1/",
    api_key=os.environ.get("PREMAI_API_KEY"),
)

# Create a chat completion
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"}],
    model="gpt-4o", # Or any other model you want to use
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Chat Completion With Streaming
<CodeGroup>
```javascript javascript/typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI({
    baseURL: "https://sid.premai.io/api/v1/",
    apiKey: process.env.PREMAI_API_KEY,
});

//Create a chat completion
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o", //Or any other model you want to use
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn." }],
    stream: true,
});

for await (const chunk of response) {
    if (chunk.choices[0].delta.content) {
        process.stdout.write(chunk.choices[0].delta.content);
        
    }
}
```
```python python
import os
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://sid.premai.io/api/v1/",
    api_key=os.environ.get("PREMAI_API_KEY"),
)

# Create completion
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"}],
    model="gpt-4o", # Or any other model you want to use
    stream=True,
)

for chunk in response:
    if chunk.choices[0].delta.content is not None:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end='', flush=True)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
The model name can be replaced with the name of your fine-tuned models as well.
</Note>

## Next steps

- Add your own [Dataset](/datasets/overview) as a first step to create your own custom models.
- Next, [Autonomously Fine-Tune](/finetuning/overview) your models using a dataset.
- Then, use [Evaluations](/evaluations/overview) to track your models performance.
- Afterwards, keep up with your model's performance with [Stats](/stats/overview).
- Finally, test models your fine-tuned models and pre-trained models in the [Playground](/playground/overview).
- Bring your models to production or repeat any steps you need to improve your models or make new ones.
