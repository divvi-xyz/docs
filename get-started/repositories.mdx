**Repositories** are **Prem's** way of utlizing easy to use **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** with a model of your choice.
 
<Tip>
 **RAG** is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of retrieval-based systems and generative models to enable assistants to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses based on the content of your documents.

 Also in plain english, **RAG** gives your models the ability to interact with your documents, gain knowledge and use it to generate responses based on the content of your documents. 

</Tip>

This guide will show you how to create **RAG-based** assistant without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure like integrating a vector database or setting up a retrieval pipeline.  
 
All you need to do is provide your documents and focus on the fun part, building your custom models and putting shipping your apps.

## Prerequisites

- Collect the documents that you'd like the AI model of your choice to interact with.

- Get a basic understanding of **Prem's** APIs and SDKs.

<Tip>
You can also connect services like [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [Cloudeflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/r2/) or a self hosted [Qdrant vector database](https://qdrant.tech/) to a repository. 

Make sure you have access to the credentials of the service you want to connect to. 

Keep in mind you can only connect one serivce to a repository.
We will cover how to connect these serrvices in this guide.

# Quick-Start: Manual Document Upload

Here is a step by step guide on how to upload documents to a repository manually. 

Its really simple and only takes a few steps. Just drag and drop your documents or go through your file explorer/finder to upload your documents and we will take care of the rest.
<Steps>
  <Step title="Create A Repository and Upload Your Documents">
  <Tip>
    The max file size is: 10MB.
    
    Prem supports file extensions such as: **pdf**, **txt**, **docx**, **md**, **sh**, **bash**, **zsh**, **js**, **ts**, **py**, **tf**, **tfvars**, and **tfstate**. 

    Ensure that the documents are clean, well-structured, and free of any formatting issues.

  </Tip>
    - Use the sidebar to navigate to the **Repositories** page. Click **_New Repository_** to create a new place to store your documents. 

<img
  src="https://static.premai.io/prem-saas-docs/repositories-guide/newRepo.gif"
  alt="Create a new repository"
/>

You can also create a Repository using the [SDK](/get-started/sdk#repositories) or the [API](/api-reference/introduction).

<Warning>
  read the [SDK](/get-started/sdk#repositories) and [API](/api-reference/introduction) documentation for more information.
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>

```typescript javascript/typescript
const response = await client.repositories.create({
    name: "test-repository",
    organization: "your-org-name",
    description: "This is a test repository"
}) 
```

```python python
response = client.repositories.create(
    name="test-repository",
    organization="your-org-name",
    description="This is a test repository"
)

print(response)
```



</CodeGroup>
    
    
 
- Upload your documents to a repository using the **Prem** web app (click the **add document** button), [API](/api-reference/introduction) or using the [SDK](/get-started/sdk#repositories). You can either upload documents individually or in batches. Make sure to provide meaningful names or identifiers for your documents.

  alt="upload a new document to a repository"
/>

<Tip>
  You can also upload documents using the [SDK](/get-started/sdk#repositories) or the [API](/api-reference/introduction).
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>

```typescript javascript/typescript
const response = await client.repository.document.create({
    repository_id: 3,
    file: "./testfile.txt" // This could be a .txt, .pdf, .docx file.
})

console.log(response)
```

```python python
response = client.repository.document.create(
    repository_id=3,
    file= "./testfile.txt" # This could be a .txt, .pdf, .docx file.
)

print(response)
```

</CodeGroup>

    - Once the documents are uploaded, **Prem** will automatically index them to enable fast and efficient retrieval. 
  <Warning>
  The indexing process may take some time depending on the size and number of documents.  
  </Warning>
  
  You can view the indexes of a document by clicking on each document in the repository as shown in the image below.
   <img

  alt="View the indexes of a document"
/>

    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a Model and Configure Retrieval Settings">
  You have three ways to configure retrival settings. In the [Lab](/get-started/lab) for testing, in the [Launchpad](/get-started/launchpad) for production and in your code using the [SDK](/get-started/sdk#repositories) or [API](/api-reference/introduction) for custom use cases. 
  
  Once you've uploaded your documents, you can choose a model and configure the retrieval settings. Head over to the [Lab](/get-started/lab) or the [Launchpad](/get-started/launchpad) if you're ready to give a model you're planning to put in production the knowledge of the doucments.   
  
   You can edit the following retrieval settings in the **Lab**,**Launchpad** or in your code using the [SDK](/get-started/sdk#repositories) or [API](/api-reference/introduction):
{/*Add pic Gif of lab and launchpad side by side */}
  - `Limit`: Sets the maximum number of top-matching documents to retrieve based on similarity.
  
  - `Similarity`: Measures how closely a query matches document embeddings. Higher values indicate greater similarity, ranging from 0 to 1.

**Here's a quick overview of the differences between the three ways to configure retrieval settings:**  
  ### Configure in Lab
  Test out how your model performs with the documents in the **Lab** playground. Click **Repo** and add a repository to each model you'd like to test. You can add up to 4 repositories to each model.
  <img
  src="https://static.premai.io/prem-saas-docs/repositories-guide/repoInLab.gif"
  alt="add a repository to the lab playground"
/>

  ### Configure on the Launchpad
  Head over to the [Launchpad](/get-started/launchpad) and click on the **_Add Repository_** button. Its right underneath the system prompt text area. 
  You can also edit the retrieval settings in the **Launchpad** under **Linked repositories**. You can add up to 4 repositories to the model you are launching.
  <img
  src="https://static.premai.io/prem-saas-docs/repositories-guide/repoInLaunchpad.gif"
  alt="add a repository to a launchpad"
/>

  ### Configure in Code
  Use the [SDK](/get-started/sdk#repositories) or [API](/api-reference/introduction) to configure the retrieval settings in your code. Its really simple and only takes a few lines of code. You can add up to 4 repositories to a model.
  <CodeGroup>

```typescript javascript/typescript
const messages = [
    { role: "user", content: "Which is Jack's pet name?" },
]

const repositories = {
  ids: [REPOSITORY_ID, ...],
  similarity_threshold: 0.65,
  limit: 3
}

// Create completion
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  project_id,
  messages,
  repositories,
  stream: false
})

console.log(response.choices[0].message.content)
// "Jack's pet name is Sparky."

console.log(response.document_chunks)
// E.g. [{ repository_id=4, document_id=14, chunk_id=15, document_name="pets_and_their_owners.txt", similarity_score=0.67, content="..." }, ...]

```

```python python
messages = [
    { "role": "user", "content": "Which is Jack's pet name?" },
]

repositories = dict(
  ids=[REPOSITORY_ID, ...],
  similarity_threshold=0.65,
  limit=3
)

# Create completion
response = client.chat.completions.create(
  project_id=8378,
  messages=messages,
  repositories=repositories,
  stream=False
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
# "Jack's pet name is Sparky."

print(response.document_chunks)
# E.g., [DocumentChunks(repository_id=4, document_id=14, chunk_id=15, document_name="pets_and_their_owners.txt", similarity_score=0.67, content="..."), ...]
```



</CodeGroup>
  
  </Step>

  <Step title = "Testing and Evaluation">
Before deploying your configured model, it's crucial to thoroughly test and evaluate its performance in the **Lab**.

 - **Test Queries:** Prepare a set of test queries that cover different scenarios and edge cases. Send these queries to your assistant and evaluate the quality and relevance of the generated responses.

 - **Iterative Refinement:** Based on the evaluation results, iteratively refine your assistant by adjusting the retrieval settings, fine-tuning the generative model, or improving the document collection.
  
  <Note>You can see which documents were used as a verified source at the bottom of the model's response.</Note>

  src="https://static.premai.io/prem-saas-docs/repositories-guide/verifiedSourceRepo.png"
  alt="View the verified source of a response when using a repository in the lab"
/>
  
  </Step>

  <Step title = "Deployment and Integration">
  Once you're satisfied with the performance of your models, you can deploy them with the [Launchpad](/get-started/launchpad) and integrate your application with the Prem [SDKs](/get-started/sdk) or [API](/api-reference/introduction).
  </Step>

# Advanced Guide

## Advanced Configurations

When creating a repository, you can configure the following advanced settings:

- `Connector`: Connect your repository to an external service like AWS S3, or Cloudflare R2.

- `Vector Store Type`: Choose between **Prem's Vector DB** or your own self hosted **Qdrant** instance.

- `Strategy`: Choose between **Default RAG** or **Hybrid RAG** strategies.
<Tip>
Default RAG and Hybrid RAG are two different strategies for using a repository. Here's a quick overview of the differences:

**Default RAG (Tradtional)**

- Single retrieval step before generation
- Simple implementation
- Best for straightforward Q&A

**Hybrid RAG**

- Multiple retrieval steps and/or methods
- Can combine different retrieval approaches
- Better for complex queries
- More robust but complex implementation
- Examples: recursive retrieval, self-querying, mixed knowledge sources
</Tip>

- Embedding Model: Choose between the following **Embedding Models** to use for your repository:

  - `text-embedding-3-large`
  - `text-embedding-3-small`
  - `text-embedding-ada-002`

<Note>
Learn more about embeddings [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings).

An embedding⁠ is a sequence of numbers that represents the concepts within content such as natural language or code. Embeddings make it easy for machine learning models and other algorithms to understand the relationships between content and to perform tasks like clustering or retrieval. They power applications like knowledge retrieval in both ChatGPT and the Assistants API, and many retrieval augmented generation (RAG) developer tools.
</Note>
  

## Connecting A Repository to AWS S3
