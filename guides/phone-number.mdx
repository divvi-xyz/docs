## Important Notes

- Phone numbers typically have a monthly subscription fee **($2/month)**
- Ensure you select a number type that suits your business needs (More countries will be added in the future)
- Numbers can be released back to the provider if no longer needed

Your AI agent will now be able to receive calls through your newly purchased phone number, providing automated assistance to your customers around the clock.
