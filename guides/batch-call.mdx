Note: The batch call requires two previously additional set up:
- **AI Agent**: You need to have an Outbound AI agent configured with a voice profile and conversation script.
- **Phone Number**: You need to have a phone number assigned to your AI agent for making outbound calls.

You can use either a single number or upload a csv file with multiple numbers. The CSV file should contain a list of phone numbers you want to call.

### Configuring Call Parameters

- Define your target audience by uploading a contact list or selecting from existing contacts
- Format your contact data appropriately (ensure phone numbers are in the correct format)
Note: A template for the contact list is available for download


## Important Tips

- Test your outbound call agent with a small sample before large-scale deployment
- Ensure compliance with local calling regulations and hours
- Monitor initial calls to verify script effectiveness and adjust as needed
- Include clear company identification in your scripts
- Provide an opt-out mechanism for recipients
- Review call analytics to optimize performance

Your outbound call agent will now be able to automatically place calls according to your configured parameters, handling routine outreach while collecting valuable data from interactions.
