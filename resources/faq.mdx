## General Questions

### What is Prem?
Prem is a AI platform that enables you to create, fine-tune, evaluate, and deploy custom AI models. It's designed to make AI integration seamless and efficient, allowing you to focus on developing your product without dealing with AI complexity.

### What can I do with Prem?
With Prem, you can:
- Access best-in-class AI models without vendor lock-in
- Autonomously fine-tune models with your own datasets
- Evaluate models using built-in metrics and tools
- Test models with the built-in Playground
- Monitor your models' performance over time with Stats

### How do I get started with Prem?
You can get started by following our [Quick Start Guide](/get-started/quick-start) which will walk you through creating your first custom AI model in minutes.

### Does Prem require machine learning expertise?
No, Prem is designed to be accessible to users without machine learning expertise. Our Autonomous Fine-Tuning feature handles the complexities of model training for you.

## Datasets

### What format should my dataset be in?
Datasets should be in **JSONL (JSON Lines)** format, where each line represents a single conversation example. Each example should contain a "messages" field with an array of message objects that have "role" and "content" fields.

### What roles are included in a dataset?
Each conversation in your dataset should include three roles:
- "system": Provides context and instructions for the model's behavior
- "user": Represents what a human user would say or ask
- "assistant": Contains the ideal response you want the model to learn

### How do I create a dataset in Prem?
You can follow our [Get Started with Datasets](/datasets/get-started) guide to learn how to create and format datasets properly.

### Can I enrich my dataset?
Yes, Prem offers dataset enrichment capabilities. You can learn more about this in our [Enrich Dataset](/datasets/enrich-dataset) documentation.

### What is a dataset snapshot?
A snapshot is a fixed version of your dataset that can be used for fine-tuning. Creating snapshots allows you to preserve specific versions of your dataset for training or comparison purposes. Learn more in the [Create Snapshot](/datasets/create-snapshot) guide.

## Fine-Tuning

### What is Autonomous Fine-Tuning?
Autonomous Fine-Tuning is Prem's approach to creating custom models without requiring machine learning expertise. It automatically handles the complexities of the fine-tuning process for you.

### Why should I fine-tune a model?
Fine-tuning offers several benefits:
- Adapts models to specific tasks or domains
- Improves performance for your specific use cases
- Requires less data and resources than training from scratch
- Allows customization to your unique requirements
- Helps overcome limitations in the original model

### How does the fine-tuning process work?
The basic process involves:
1. Creating a snapshot of your dataset
2. Fine-tuning your selected model on this dataset snapshot
3. Evaluating the resulting model to verify performance

### How long does fine-tuning take?
Fine-tuning duration depends on your dataset size and the model you're using. Typically, the process can take anywhere from minutes to a few hours.

## Evaluations

### What are model evaluations?
Model evaluations are systematic assessments of how well AI models perform on specific tasks, measuring aspects like accuracy, reliability, fairness, safety, and alignment with human preferences.

### Why are evaluations necessary?
Evaluations are critical for:
- Quality assurance before deployment
- Identifying areas needing improvement
- Optimizing costs by selecting the most efficient model
- Mitigating risks by detecting potential biases or unsafe outputs
- Tracking performance progress over time

### How does Prem's evaluation system work?
Prem offers an integrated evaluation system that:
- Seamlessly evaluates models within the same platform
- Uses your actual datasets for real-world performance testing
- Provides comparative analysis between different models
- Enables continuous monitoring of model performance

### What metrics are used for evaluation?
Prem offers various evaluation metrics depending on your use case. For specific information about available metrics, please refer to our [Evaluations Overview](/evaluations/overview) documentation.

## Models

### What models are available on Prem?
Prem offers a wide range of models from providers like Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI (GPT), Meta (Llama), Google (Gemma), and others. For a complete and up-to-date list, see our [Available Models](/resources/available-models) page.

### Can I use my own custom models?
Yes, Prem allows you to fine-tune existing models to create your own custom versions tailored to your specific use cases.

### How do I choose the right model for my use case?
The best model depends on your specific requirements, including:
- Task complexity
- Performance needs
- Resource constraints
- Budget considerations
You can use our Playground and Evaluation tools to compare different models for your specific use case.
