# Creating a Dataset

<Steps>
    <Step title="Click + Create To Create a Dataset">
    <img src="https://static.premai.io/prem-saas-docs/datasets/get-started/step-0-createDataset.gif" alt="GIF of clicking the create a dataset button" />

     To create a dataset, click the **+ Create Dataset** button in the top right corner of the page.

     you have some options here:
     - Upload a JSONL file with conversation datapoints
     - Generate synthetic data from text and pdf files

    </Step>
    <Step title="Upload a File">
    <img src="https://static.premai.io/prem-saas-docs/datasets/get-started/step-2-upload-dataset.gif" alt="GIF of uploading a file" />
       - Choose a name for your dataset.
       - Write a system prompt for your dataset.
       - Upload a `JSONL` file.
       - Click **Confirm** to create the dataset.
        <Tip>
             Refer to our [Datasets](/datasets/overview) documentation for more information on the `JSONL` file format.
        </Tip>

        <Note>
            When you upload a `JSONL` file, Prem will automatically create a system prompt for you that you can edit.
       </Note>

    </Step>

</Steps>

## Upload with Synthetic Data Generation

You may have unstructured data stored in different file types that are not in the `JSONL` format. This is where our synthetic data generation comes in. You can upload these files to Prem and generate synthetic data based on your files.



    You can import the following files:
    - PDF files
    - TXT files
    - DOC files
    - DOCX files
    - HTML files
    - PPT files

    <Steps>
        <Step title="Choose a name for your dataset">
            Enter a descriptive name for your dataset that will help you identify it later.
        </Step>
        <Step title="Write a system prompt for your dataset">
            Create a system prompt that will guide the synthetic data generation process.
        </Step>
        <Step title="Upload your file">
            Upload your file (PDF, TXT, DOC, DOCX, HTML, or PPT) that will be used to generate synthetic data.
        </Step>
        <Step title="Click Confirm">
            Review your settings and click **Confirm** to start the synthetic data generation process.
        </Step>
    </Steps>

### Options for Synthetic Data Generation

### Types of Pairs to Generate
QA: Generate question-answer pairs from your content. You can create multiple pairs per file.

Summary: Generate one summary per file. The number of synthetic pairs equals the number of files uploaded.

### New Pairs to Generate

For QA pairs, you can generate multiple question-answer pairs per file. The minimum is set to the number of files uploaded, and you can increase it in increments based on your file count.

### User Instructions (optional)

You can add user instructions to the synthetic data generation process. This will be added to the system prompt for each pair.
