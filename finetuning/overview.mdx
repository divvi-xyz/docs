# Overview
Prem offers **Autonomous Finetuning** so you can create a custom model without having to be a machine learning expert. 

Fine-tuning an AI model serves several important purposes:


- Adaptation to specific tasks: Fine-tuning allows a pre-trained model to specialize in particular domains or tasks that may differ from its original training data.


- Improved performance: It typically enhances accuracy and relevance for specific use cases compared to using a generic model.


- Efficiency: Fine-tuning requires significantly less data and computational resources than training a model from scratch.


- Customization: Organizations can tailor models to their unique requirements, terminology, or style.


- Overcoming limitations: It can help address biases or gaps in the original model's knowledge for particular applications.


- Rapid development: Fine-tuning accelerates the deployment of AI solutions by building on existing model capabilities.

# How it works

1. Create a [Snapshot](/datasets/create-snapshot) of your [dataset](/datasets/overview).
2. [Fine-tune](/finetuning/get-started) your model on your [dataset](/datasets/overview).
3. [Evaluate](/evaluations/get-started) your model.
